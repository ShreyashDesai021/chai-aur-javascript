console.log("promises");

//Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript. They represent a value that may 
// be available now, or in the future, or never.
//A Promise is in one of these states:
//Pending: Initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
//Fulfilled: The operation completed successfully.
//Rejected: The operation failed.

//Promises are used in various scenarios, such as:
//1. Fetching data from an API
//2. Reading files
//3. Performing asynchronous computations

// In fields like:
//1. Networking
//2. File I/O
//3. User Interface interactions
// 4. Database operations
// 5. Cryptography
